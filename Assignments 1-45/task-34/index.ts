console.log(`I absolutely love pizza! There are so many different kinds to choose from,
but my personal favorites are pepperoni, margherita, and veggie.
I love pepperoni for its classic taste and simplicity,
while margherita offers a delightful balance of tangy tomato sauce,
fragrant basil, and creamy mozzarella. As for veggie pizza,
I enjoy the variety of colorful and flavorful toppings like bell peppers,
onions, olives, and mushrooms. Pizza is always my go-to comfort food and 
I could eat it for every meal!`);
